It sickens me to see people constantly recycle unsubstantiated claims about him, or anyone for that matter, over and over.

Forget the trial, lock 'em up, toss the key”\nDot the T's, cross the I's, lots of apostrophes\nCoughing up boxes of bucks to stay lost in the fog of this obnoxious process\nMy conscience is quiet, ensconced in the tarpit\nCover the garden with carpet, forget and get onto the starship\nWe're off to another dimension – the rent's too expensive here\nSpent my whole pension improving my penmanship\nWhen does it get any closer to ending? \nAnd can I just mention the stench?\nIt's relentless when in the presence of elegant gentlemen\nThe villains have taken their vengeance\nI regret to say they've collected the evidence\nRepent and pretend every entrance is open to tenants with references\nDeclare myself president of the emptiness, say I'm Rembrandt of dancing on the precipice\nEleven years in and trying to stay relevant\nBut based on what's left of the remnants of my intestines\nI would guess I've ingested the medicine\nYes, I've been everywhere but everywhere that I've been\nI've been out of my element, even in my own skin\nAnd I can't begin to think what I'd tell people back home\nSo I tell it to the microphone\nI can't leave the life alone – yeah.\n\nCAST (in order of appearance) ::\n\nPatrick Stickles\nKevin S.

Dr. Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis) is a surgeon who only sees the aftermath of his city’s violence as it’s rushed into his ER – until his wife (Elisabeth Shue) and college-age daughter (Camila Morrone) are viciously attacked in their suburban home. With the police overloaded with crimes, Paul, burning for revenge, hunts for his family’s assailants to deliver justice.

The script is over 150 pages so I’m only going over things that  are not included in the movie and there Aare lots of them which is why the video is pretty long but it’s totally worth it since we finally get answers for basically everything. All engineer dialogs and writings in the script are translated so we are getting a clear understanding things without over theorizing.\n\nThe script is written by Damon Lindelof and the awakened engineer is referred in conversations as the Last Engineer.  \n\nTHE ELDER Take this. This is the blood of our lord. For we cannot create as the gift was stripped from us long ago. As always we will continue our attempts to create a perfect Eden much like our own. You, the chosen one will create it in your own image.\nLet your body become the dirt. Your blood become the waters. And may your soul become their way back to us\n\nThere are lots of interesting details that are brought up in this dialog. First we learn that the substance in the sealed cup is the blood of their lord which really intrigued me when I first read it. I wouldn’t say the substance is completely gold in the movie, however it certainly has some golden shades. But most importantly we get a confirmation that it’s not the black go.  Another thing is that the elder was thousands of years old. All of these new elements are addressed later in the script so we will get back to them. \n\nDAVID reads in engineer language Only the chosen can pass through. This is sacred ground and must be kept sacred. If you dare to cross into sacred ground you must be punished. This is the birth place of our lord and no being is worthy \n \nHolloway arrives around the BACK of the monument and shines his light up at another MURAL which has been embedded on the wall. A strange BEING unlike any ENGINEER is drawn on the MURAL. It has it's arms out in a cross. Around the MURAL it shows an IMAGE of an engineer being ATTACKED and impregnated by some NASTY looking OCTOPUS type CREATURE. The being with it's arms stretched out is a bipedal POINTY-HEADED creature - the first “DEACON”.\n\n DAVID (Engineer language) Our lord came from the chosen one in the time when our ancestors birthed life. His sacred blood was our salvation. His sacred blood through our lips birthed life on other worlds. \n DAVID I am not entirely certain, but I believe the humanoid seen being attacked orally gave birth to this being and your Engineers worshiped it. I believe what is ever inside these capsules might be some kind of experiment. If my translation is correct then they were trying to recreate the blood of this being whom they worshiped.\nRecall that the elder engineer said in the beginning:   \nwe cannot create as the gift was stripped from us long ago. As always we will continue our attempts to create a perfect Eden much like our own.\nDespite the fact that engineers could live for thousands of years, they were slowly dying off and their only way to prevent extinction was to seed with life other planets using the blood of the first deacon. \nThey were traveling through space seeding planets with life in an attempt to recreate their homewolrd, but the blood of the first deacon was running out.\nIt appears that these beings can live up to three hundred thousand years old. They use to be able to mate with each other just like humans. But somewhere in their late history they evolved and lost the ability to both mate and reproduce. But before they did they found a creature that impregnated one of them with a foreign body. A creature came from him. They called it the Deacon. They worshiped this deacon and after it's death they used its blood to plant the seeds of life on other worlds. The blood ran out of course but they tried to recreate the gene pool of this Deacon's blood but they instead created something else. That is what I brought back with me, sir.\n\nMuch later in the script when Weyland, David, shaw and some other crew members approach the sleeping engineer, David explains that dispite the fact the black goo was the failed attempt of clonning the blood of the first deacon, engineers realized it’s potential for weapons.\n\nHate? We gave you this emotion. We gave you all emotion We had expected not of your evolution. We gave you Eden.We came back and saved your souls but we left you to make your own fate. But your kind is a barbaric violent species. We tried once more to save you.",False

Michail, Will Arnett and Peggy Regan are producing, with Sam Register, Jelenic, and Horvath serving as executive producers.  Apart from Arnett, all are “Teen Titans GO!” series contributors.\n\nSet to release on July 27, 2018, “Teen Titans GO! to the Movies” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

And thank you, for everything else. The opportunities, the love and support, the friendship. All of this that exists is beautiful, and I cherish it endlessly. I am sending you loads of happy thoughts. Make the rest of your day amazing, to the best of your ability!\n       This past month saw so many things! For one, it was finals week. This year, things were a little different for my department. We don’t get a huge final assignment, but instead our final is a compiled evaluation of everything we did in our studios this last term. (2 classes out of 5) \n        I was so lucky to get to go skiing twice in the span of a month- for the 2nd and 3rd time ever!! I am slowly getting the hang of it…… ha...I didn’t do so bad, considering that it was early winter, and the conditions were reaally really bad. So icy, it was more like hail balls. There wasn’t so much footage during those small trips, because I took the time to enjoy everything without rushing to capture it through the lens. It was nice to unwind and relax.\nAfter going back to new york, spending a couple days there ended with flying home. Our house was very different without my grandparents. Especially contrasting it to my christmas vlog last year, there is no running away from life’s truth that things will change, and there is no stopping it. My grandpa is in his last days, and my grandma insists on being by his side in the care home everyday. I would visit a few times, although he rarely gains consciousness anymore. My heart and prayers go out to him. Thank you for all of your prayers, too. Truly.\n          Despite everything, I’m glad my sister and I still pulled together a little dinner! We last minute thought, “why not”, the morning of. The spirit was just absent this year. And sometimes, it’s hard being the only one who cares. If it weren’t for my sister, this wouldn’t have happened! That’s why I’m thankful that we still made the best of it. \nI had a year filled with so many new experiences, lessons, and ups & downs, and the vlog ends with us entering the new year. Thank you for being on this journey with me, I love you.\nYours truly,\nAnnabelle\n____________\nIN THIS VIDEO:\n00:27 *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2h6bWmq\n Grey hoodie- HANES\n01:17 black sweater- stole from dad\n Jeans- THRIFTED\n Boots- DOC MARTINS\n01:27 bath bomb- LUSH https://goo.gl/yRJLcf\n02:12 coat- TOPSHOP\nRest of ski clothes- SAVERS/rentals\n03:55 dress- THRIFTED in LA\n Xmas tree- TARGET\n04:03 head bands- DOLLAR TREE\n05:12 white longsleeve- UNIQLO https://goo.gl/AAUS5X\n05:46 apron- MINISO\n06:55 grey crewneck- one that I designed back in highschool.\n07:50 jeans- THRIFTED\n Pink hoodie- (I got it at a craft's store but you can buy here with a bunch more color options https://goo.gl/XPH0W5)\n08:20 scarf- ALDO ACCESSORIES\n Coat- ZARA\n11:24 *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2gWwgDh\n *hoop earrings- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2tghElU\n11:45 single bulbs- AMAZON https://goo.gl/Y7LZQw\n *yellow sweater- SHEIN http://bit.ly/2imMvd4 \n12:14 ski helmet- AMAZON https://goo.gl/MF31Gg\n14:07 clothing rack- AMAZON https://goo.gl/hy6i3H\n16:55 blue sweater- FOREVER21\n Laundry basket- DAISO\n17:33 brown sweater- mom’s, think she bought it from taobao\n Pj pants- TARGET\n Xmas tree- $5 tree from CVS we bought TEN YEARS AGO HAHA\n19:16 the kitchen timer of my dreams- ANTHROPOLOGIE  (kikkerland) https://goo.gl/rMKM9y\n20:17 scarf- ALDO\n jacket - BERSHKA\n21:58 grey fleece jacket- stole from dad\n_____________\nDISCOUNTS + PROMO CODES FOR YOU 💞\n$10 OFF AMAZON PRIME\nhttp://a.co/1q3PK8j\nAIRBNB:\nhttp://www.airbnb.com/c/annabelleg169 for $40 AIRBNB travel \nCredit!\nGRUBHUB (FOOD!!)\nhttps://refer.grubhub.com/s/nunnp for $7 off your order\nEYEBUYDIRECT:\n IFE2MWGNTM  for $10 discount on eyebuydirect.com\ninstagram: http://instagram.com/pyperbleu\nCats’ instagram: http://instagram.com/catcreatures\ntwitter: https://twitter.com/pyperbleu      \n__\nVIDEO:\n-Final Cut Pro x edited by Annabelle G\n-Canon PowershotG7x + iphone 7\n \nMUSIC: songs from epidemicsound.com \nFTC DISCLAIMER: Not a sponsored video.

Thought about making them sunglasses, but it'd still get hit first before the back of the head did and overall was unfairly annoying.\nMishkin/Donkey Kong is no longer the Defense Minister, that role now goes to May Day/Pauline with Donkey Kong being the Head of Special Forces. This was done to give Pauline a role in the story, as well as explain why the Great Guards use DK's body.\nDr Doak is now Oddjob/Toad to give him some sort of role in the story, as a result the idea of Toad blending in with the other scientists is ridiculous.\n\nDownload: http://goldeneyevault.com/viewfile.php?id=400\n\nFaceBook Page: www.facebook.com/StupidMarioBros1Fan\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/StupidMarioFan1\n\nAll copyrighted materials belong to their respective owners.
