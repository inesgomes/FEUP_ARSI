[아는형님]은 이 두 캐릭터의 상호보완을 통해 절친 케미를 완성했다. 그리고, TV 프로그램과 두 절친의 시너지는 프로젝트 음원의 차트 정상이라는 특별한 성공을 선물했다.\n\n민경훈과의 듀엣을 통해 보컬로서의 파괴력을 확인시켜 준 김희철, 김희철과의 듀엣을 통해 대중에게 다시금 어필하는 데 성공한 민경훈. 서로를 통해 많은 것을 얻어 낸 김희철과 민경훈의 두 번째 음원은 어쩌면 너무 늦었다.\n\n두 번째 음원 ‘후유증 (Falling Blossoms)’ 역시 ‘나비잠’과 같은 록발라드 곡이다. [아는형님]의 ‘뮤비대전’을 통해 TV 프로그램과의 시너지 또한 그대로 재현될 예정이며, ‘나비잠’을 작곡한 이상준과 차길완이 다시 작곡을 맡았다. ‘나비잠’을 김희철이 작사했고, 이번 ‘후유증’을 민경훈이 작사했다는 점을 제외하면 두 곡은 같은 연장선에 놓인다. \n\n민경훈이 버즈 멤버 윤우현, 신준기와 함께 완성한 가사에는 지워지지 않는 사랑의 아픔이 담겼고, 우주겁쟁이 두 사람은 이별 후에 알게 된 소중함과 그리움을 애절하게 노래했다. 김희철은 허스키한 보이스로 록발라더의 멋을 뽐냈고, 민경훈은 본인 특유의 격정을 다시 한 번 끌어올렸다. 두 사람이 절반씩 파트를 가져가며 곡에 대등하게 기여하고 있다는 점이 인상적이며, 반대로 김희철의 하모니 베이스 위에서 감성을 폭발시키는 가창의 분업 또한 인상적이다.\n\n도입부 등에서 사용된 어쿠스틱 기타 사운드, 김희철의 내던지는 창법과 멜로디는 90년대 메탈 발라드의 장점을, 후반부의 격정적인 현악과 호소력 강한 민경훈의 창법에서는 한국 발라드의 장점이 어필한다. 여러모로 다르고, 그 다름으로 인해 서로에게 기여하는 두 사람이다.

The first single from 'Aunty Donna - The Album'! In this music video we see Broden Kelly (Manbeast in 1999, Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing) take on the role of Dad. Dad is a father who likes to sing songs about all the things that make him happy or chuffed. From pies to nice jeans to not watching south park, find out all the things Dad likes. Also stars Mark Bonanno (Mark in Aunty Donna webisodes) and Zachary Ruane (a dodgy car part in a car commercial once)\n\nFeaturing Aaron Gocs: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDyN7DR9xukTxkSE7eUqsQ\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/TheAuntyDonna\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/AuntyDonnaBoys\nINSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/theauntydonnagallery\nSOUND CLOUD: https://soundcloud.com/auntydonna \nAUNTY DONNA PODCAST : https://www.planetbroadcasting.com/our-shows/aunty-donna/\n\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMIX + MASTERED by Klaus Hill\nTHEME SONG: Aunty Donna x SUB-human\nSPECIAL THANKS: Alex Pizzol, Joe Kosky, Michelle Brasier, Sammy J \n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nDIRECTOR / DOP Max Miller\nPRODUCER / 1st AD Jessica Galea\n\nFEATURING Aaron Gocs and Albert Goikhman\n\n1st AC Fabio Capodivento\nGAFFER Alastair Duffield\nBEST GIRL Hannah Palmer\n\nCOSTUME DESIGNER Ingrid Beilharz\nCOSTUME ASSISTANT Gemma Baker\n\nPRODUCTION DESIGNER William Bobbie Stewart\nPROPS ASSISTANT Georgie Thomas\n\nBTS Kiralee Greenhalgh\nPROMO SHOTS Keith D’Cunha\nRUNNER Josh Howlett\n\nEDITOR / COLOURIST Max Miller\n\nAUNTY DONNA is\nTom Armstrong, Mark Samual Bonanno, Broden Kelly, Samuel Lingham, Max Miller and Zachary Ruane\n\nhttp://www.auntydonna.com",False

The “Ride For Me” rapper helped “shut down” Philipp Plein’s star-studded Fall/Winter 2018 show, and also made an appearance at VFILES’ seasonal showcase. To provide a more in-depth look at Thugger’s recent NYFW experience, we linked up with the rapper at the aforementioned VFILES show to get a few of his thoughts on fashion, music and more.\n\n“I am fashion,” Young Thug tells us. “I don’t think I can even get in no deeper. I wake up and breathe this.”\n\nElsewhere, the Atlanta native opened up about wanting to turn clothes he saw on Discovery Channel programs into fashionable outfits, being a trend-setter and wanting to learn sign language. “I got a deaf brother,” he shares. “So, I want to act deaf for a year … I ain’t going to put out no music this year.” However, he does mention a possibility of dropping the long-awaited, oft-delayed Hi-Tunes album.\n\nMusic by: mjNichols (www.youtube.com/mjNichols)\n\nFor up-to-date news and more: http://HYPEBEAST.com\nView more HYPEBEAST videos: http://YOUTUBE.com/user/HypebeastTV\n\nStay connected with us on your favorite social media platform:\n\nhttp://FACEBOOK.com/hypebeast\nhttp://TWITTER.com/hypebeast\nhttp://TUMBLR.com/tagged/hypebeast\nhttp://PINTEREST.com/hypebeast\nhttp://INSTAGRAM.com/hypebeast",False

But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.",False

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.
