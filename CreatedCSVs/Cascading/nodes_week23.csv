Pictures’ “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” is the second of five all new adventures in J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World™.  \n\nAt the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne).  But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings.  \n\nIn an effort to thwart Grindelwald’s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead.  Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.  \n\nThe film features an ensemble cast led by Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp.  The cast also includes, Zoë Kravitz, Callum Turner, Claudia Kim, William Nadylam, Kevin Guthrie, Carmen Ejogo, and  Poppy Corby-Tuech.\n\n“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” is directed by David Yates, from a screenplay by J.K. Rowling.  The film is produced by David Heyman, J.K. Rowling, Steve Kloves and Lionel Wigram.  \n\nSlated for release on November 16, 2018, the film will be distributed worldwide in 2D and 3D in select theatres and IMAX by Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, tensions between Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes) continue to escalate just as Alice (Madchen Amick) announces she is joining the musical to spend more time with Betty.  Elsewhere, Hiram (Mark Consuelos) enacts a devious plan to further drive a wedge between Fred (Luke Perry) and Archie (KJ Apa), while Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch) channels Carrie White during a showdown with her mother. Marisol Nichols, Ashleigh Murray and Skeet Ulrich also star. Jason Stone directed the episode written by Arabella Anderson & Tessa Leigh Williams (#218). Original airdate 4/18/2018.

On June 8th, Tremonti returns with their fourth album A Dying Machine, a concept album that showcases Mark’s unique songwriting style and vocal melodies. Anthemic choruses, punishing riffs and fiery guitar solos are displayed on the album in rockers like ‘From the sky’ and ‘Throw them to the lions’ and places them alongside the infectiously catchy ‘Take you with me’ and ‘The first the last’.\n\nTremonti will be on a worldwide tour in support of A Dying Machine including opening for Iron Maiden this summer.",False

It is intended to be the first film in Sony's Marvel Universe, adjunct to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, Kelly Marcel and Will Beall, and stars Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock / Venom, alongside Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott Haze, and Reid Scott.\n\nDevelopment of a Venom film, a spin-off from the Spider-Man film franchise, first began with producer Avi Arad in 2007. After various iterations, work on a new version began in March 2017 to start a new shared universe featuring the Marvel characters to which Sony possessed the film rights, though Sony also intends for the film to share the world of Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is set in the MCU after a deal between Sony and Marvel Studios. Rosenberg and Pinkner were set to write, with Fleischer and Hardy added in May 2017. Principal photography began in October 2017, taking place in Atlanta, New York City, and San Francisco.\n\nCast\n\nTom Hardy as Eddie Brock / Venom: The host of an alien symbiote that gives him incredible powers. Director Ruben Fleischer took inspiration for the character's portrayal from a quote in the comics: You're Eddie Brock. I'm the symbiote. Together we are Venom. Hardy also did performance capture for the role.\nMichelle Williams as Ann Weying\nRiz Ahmed\nScott Haze\nReid Scott\nSope Aluko has been cast in an undisclosed role",False

Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest",False
