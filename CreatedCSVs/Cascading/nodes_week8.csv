As the longest-running scripted series in television history, THE SIMPSONS has become one of the most consistently groundbreaking, innovative and recognizable entertainment franchises throughout the world. With its subversive humor and delightful wit, the series has made an indelible imprint on American pop culture, and its family members – HOMER (Dan Castellaneta), MARGE (Julie Kavner), BART (Nancy Cartwright), LISA (Yeardley Smith) and MAGGIE – are television icons. Recently renewed for the unprecedented 28th season, THE SIMPSONS has won 31 Emmy Awards, a 2015 People’s Choice Award and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2012 for the theatrical short “The Longest Daycare.” The series recently received five 2015 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Animated Program. “The Simpsons Movie” was a hit feature film; the mega-attraction “The Simpsons Ride” at Universal Studios has received historic expansion updates with the addition of Springfield added to the roster; and the show was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000. It was named the “Best Show of the 20th Century” by Time magazine, and called the “Greatest American Sitcom” by Entertainment Weekly in 2013. \n\nMueller Meets Trump | Season 29 | THE SIMPSONS\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ANIMATIONonFOX",False

Dr. Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis) is a surgeon who only sees the aftermath of his city’s violence as it’s rushed into his ER – until his wife (Elisabeth Shue) and college-age daughter (Camila Morrone) are viciously attacked in their suburban home. With the police overloaded with crimes, Paul, burning for revenge, hunts for his family’s assailants to deliver justice. As the anonymous slayings of criminals grabs the media’s attention, the city wonders if this deadly avenger is a guardian angel…or a grim reaper.

With its subversive humor and delightful wit, the series has made an indelible imprint on American pop culture, and its family members – HOMER (Dan Castellaneta), MARGE (Julie Kavner), BART (Nancy Cartwright), LISA (Yeardley Smith) and MAGGIE – are television icons. Recently renewed for the unprecedented 28th season, THE SIMPSONS has won 31 Emmy Awards, a 2015 People’s Choice Award and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2012 for the theatrical short “The Longest Daycare.” The series recently received five 2015 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Animated Program. “The Simpsons Movie” was a hit feature film; the mega-attraction “The Simpsons Ride” at Universal Studios has received historic expansion updates with the addition of Springfield added to the roster; and the show was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2000. It was named the “Best Show of the 20th Century” by Time magazine, and called the “Greatest American Sitcom” by Entertainment Weekly in 2013. \n\nPreview: Ed Sheeran Is Playing Springfield | Season 29 Ep. 10 | THE SIMPSONS\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ANIMATIONonFOX",False

Forget the trial, lock 'em up, toss the key”\nDot the T's, cross the I's, lots of apostrophes\nCoughing up boxes of bucks to stay lost in the fog of this obnoxious process\nMy conscience is quiet, ensconced in the tarpit\nCover the garden with carpet, forget and get onto the starship\nWe're off to another dimension – the rent's too expensive here\nSpent my whole pension improving my penmanship\nWhen does it get any closer to ending? \nAnd can I just mention the stench?\nIt's relentless when in the presence of elegant gentlemen\nThe villains have taken their vengeance\nI regret to say they've collected the evidence\nRepent and pretend every entrance is open to tenants with references\nDeclare myself president of the emptiness, say I'm Rembrandt of dancing on the precipice\nEleven years in and trying to stay relevant\nBut based on what's left of the remnants of my intestines\nI would guess I've ingested the medicine\nYes, I've been everywhere but everywhere that I've been\nI've been out of my element, even in my own skin\nAnd I can't begin to think what I'd tell people back home\nSo I tell it to the microphone\nI can't leave the life alone – yeah.\n\nCAST (in order of appearance) ::\n\nPatrick Stickles\nKevin S.

What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS\n\nthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs\n\nWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.\n\nThey choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.\n\nJonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.\n\nThey moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.\n\n********************************",False

Tell us what you think in the comment section below.\n\nRead more here: https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/12/18/16791844/star-wars-last-jedi-backlash-controversy\n\nA divide between movie audiences and critics happens all the time — especially with blockbusters.\n\nConsider the recent case of Justice League, which brought together a bunch of big-name superheroes, to the delight of 79 percent of those who saw it and bothered to register their opinion on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics, however, only liked the film to the tune of a 40 percent score — a 39-point gap. There’s also 2016’s Suicide Squad, with a 26 percent score from critics and a 61 percent score from audiences, for a 35-point gap.\n\nThese gaps are normal. If you’ve bought a ticket for a movie — as opposed to having seen it at a free critics screening — you’re far more likely to have self-selected as a fan already, and thus, you’re far more likely to be into the movie. (If you were to make the argument that Rotten Tomatoes is a deeply flawed system at best and actively harmful to the future of criticism at worst, well, I wouldn’t stop you.)\nSo there’s a pattern. Critics savage a blockbuster. Audiences feel it’s better than its reputation.

Do you think the fact that as we are in Dec and still not had a trailer for “Solo: A Star Wars Story” means the film isn’t good? if not when do you see Disney releasing it?\n\nShaun Wren - My question is regarding Andy Serkis' Jungle Book movie at Warner Bros. It recently got a new title Mowgli and an official synopsis and after reading it and the voice cast, could this be a sleeper 2018 hit?

However, for a supernova to produce the same effects it needs to be much closer – within 20 to 30 light years. There are definitely no stars in that range that could explode any time soon. However the Sun isn’t stationary. It orbits the Milky Way, and its galactic neighbors come and go. Maybe in a few 250-million-year orbits we stellar timebomb will wander into our vicinity. However it’s really the GRBs that are most likely to hit us first, and hit us more often. We should certainly expect one in the next half-to-one-billion years, even if it’s not WR104.\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Matt O'Dowd\nProduced by Rusty Ward\nGraphics by Kurt Ross\nAssistant Editing and Sound Design by Mike Petrow and Meah Denee Barrington\nMade by Kornhaber Brown (www.kornhaberbrown.com)\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Big Bang, Quasar and Hypernova Supporters: \n\nBig Bang\nCoolAsCats\nDavid Nicklas\nWilliam James Sidis\n\nQuasar\nTambe Barsbay\nMayank M.
